Hej,

I am writing to apply for the React Native Developer role at humblebee. I have ample experience in building web applications using JavaScript for both the frontend and backend. I possess a strong understanding of React and React Native and good hands on with Google and AWS Cloud

I take great pride in producing clean and high-quality code. Being fluent in English, I excel at communication and collaborating with team members. My practical approach, self-motivation, and ability to connect with others make me a valuable team player.

Aside from the essential requirements, I have gained hands-on experience working in startup environments, which has enhanced my adaptability and ability to thrive in dynamic settings. Additionally, I am well-versed with the agile methodoly and tools like JIRA. Although knowledge of TypeScript is considered a plus, I am quite familiar with it and eager to expand my skill set to meet the evolving demands of the role. 

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to join humblebee and contribute to the team. 
My preferred working location is Skane/Stockholm, and I would be available to start in around 30 days. Additionally, I am willing to sponsor my own relocation to ensure a smooth transition to the new location.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be delighted to talk about how my abilities and expertise can help your team in an interview.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,
Anurag Deore.
